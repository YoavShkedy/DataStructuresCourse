# AVLTreeList

## Overview
This project is a comprehensive implementation of the AVL Tree, a self-balancing binary search tree. Developed as part of Tel Aviv University Data Structures course, this project showcases the intricacies and functionalities of AVL Trees.

## Purpose
AVL Trees are renowned for their ability to maintain balance, ensuring that operations like insertion, deletion, and lookup can be performed in logarithmic time. The AVLTreeList project encapsulates this principle, providing a robust data structure that automatically balances itself to optimize operations.

## Features
* Self-Balancing: At the heart of the AVL Tree is its self-balancing property. After every insertion or deletion, the tree checks its balance and restructures itself if needed, ensuring optimal performance.

* Node Representation: Each node in the tree contains not just data but also metadata about its position in the tree, such as its height and the size of its subtree. This metadata aids in the self-balancing property of the tree.

* Versatility: While the primary purpose is to serve as a balanced binary search tree, the structure can be extended for various applications, such as sorted dictionaries, priority queues, and more.

* Educational Value: As part of an academic course, this project serves as both a practical tool and an educational resource, helping students grasp the inner workings and advantages of AVL Trees.
